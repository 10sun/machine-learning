The author wanted to compare his stats to all others in the Pacific Coast League from 1960-2014 to see if the \"nearest neighbors\" for stats in that context aligned with players that made it to the majors to see if the perfomance can be projected into that level of competition. \n",
    "- KNN is on the simpler end of the spectrum of Machine Learning algorithms and can be used for either regression or classification. It is a \"lazy learner\" which means the learning function is appoximated locally and computation is deferred until the prediction query. This means \"training\" (though training is not explicit) time is minimal which can be a benefit (compared to training time needed for other algorithms). KNN performs well with limited dimensions and size of input data.\n",
    "- Becasue KNN is lazy, it also has related shortcomings. Restricting the learning function to local data means that learning is highly sensitive to the local structure of the data and that the computation of the prediction can take longer. With large input data sets or those with high dimensionality, feature extraction and/or dimension reduction are typically used as a preprocessing step to minimize the curse of dimensionality. This detracts from the simplicity of setting up a KNN model. Furthermore, KNN doesn't know which of the features are more or less important and that relative importance can be skewed by a feature with a larger scaling because it relies on a calculated vector distance to define the neighborhood. This means the weights and number of neighbors included needs to be tuned.\n",
    "- KNN for this problem could be a good place to start because of the simplicity of setting up the model; however, getting good prediciton would most likely require selecting only a limited number features to include in the input data. My assumption is also that a pattern can be found from the students who failed that requires less than 10 parameters (that there will likely be a few key factors that can be correllated to failing like having a full time job).\n",

    "- Because SVMs are binary linear classifiers, they do well in predicting a classification with one of two possible labels, while minimizing the classification error AND maximizing the geometric margin between the labels. This binary quality i.e. \"two-class tasks\" means they are relatively simple to conceptualize (and visualize graphically). They do well with high dimensional data sets.\n",
    "- For multi-class tasks where there are more than two labels, SVMs need to be combined with other methods or simplified into binary problems. SVMs also require full labeling of the input data so all data has to be preprocessed/wrangled before inputting to the model. The selection of the kernel and definition of its parameters plays a big part in how effective the predictions are when the classification is non-linear which could require tuning. Also, SVMs do not perform well when the data doesn't have a clear margin for the binary prediction, when the data is noisy, or when the dataset is large.  Our prediction results are also limited to the labels (and not the probability of the labels) directly so we do not have a measure of confidence in the prediction out of the box.\n",
    "- Since our problem is binary (will the student fail or pass) and our data set has a high dimension, SVMs are a good option to consider; however, it will come with a prerequisite preprocessing of the data to ensure all items are labeled and labeled with numerical data. \n",

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
